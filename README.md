## 4. Battery Specifications and Purchase Guidelines

### Size
* Flat-top batteries are recommended, but not strictly required.
* Ensure the battery is **exactly `65 mm` long**. Some batteries may be `2-3 mm` longer, which will prevent them from fitting into the holders.

### Characteristics
* **Voltage:** `3.7 Volts`
* **Current:** The rated current must be **not less than `10 Amperes`**. This parameter is the most crucial for performance and safety. Avoid buying batteries designed for flashlights, especially if the current rating is not explicitly indicated on the packaging.
* **Recommended Capacity:** `2500-3800 mAh`. Be cautious: if you see capacities advertised as `4000-9000 mAh`, consider that this is likely a fake capacity.

### Where to Buy
* This type of battery can reliably be purchased in **vape shops**.
* It is always best to purchase batteries from well-known and reputable brands, such as **Samsung, LG, or Sony**.
