## 4. Battery Specifications and Purchase Guidelines

### Size
* Flat-top batteries are recommended, but not strictly required.
* Ensure the battery is **exactly `65 mm` long**. Some batteries may be `2-3 mm` longer, which will prevent them from fitting into the holders.

### Characteristics
* **Voltage:** `3.7 Volts`
* **Current:** The rated current must be **not less than `10 Amperes`**. This parameter is the most crucial for performance and safety. Avoid buying batteries designed for flashlights, especially if the current rating is not explicitly indicated on the packaging.
* **Recommended Capacity:** `2500-3800 mAh`.  
  Be cautious: if you see capacities advertised as `4000-9000 mAh`, consider that this is likely a fake capacity.
